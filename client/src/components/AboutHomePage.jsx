              The concept of SubSphere came about through my personal financial
              despair. I was losing my subscriptions left and rightâ€”a streaming
              service for one thing, a software license elsewhere. It was a
              confusing mess. I would easily forget which services I had even
              subscribed to until I saw an unexpected charge from one of my
              youtube memberships on my bank statement.

              The greatest difficulty was forgetting reminders. Without a single
              location to view future payments, I was constantly caught off
              guard, and it became tough to budget. I realized I needed an easy,
              centralized solution to view everything at once and receive timely
              reminders before a bill is due. That personal pain was the direct
              inspiration for creating SubSphere: an easy, clean way to regain
              control over repeating bills.
