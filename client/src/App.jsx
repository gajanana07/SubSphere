          The concept of SubSphere came about through my personal financial
          despair. I was losing my subscriptions left and rightâ€”a streaming
          service for one thing, a software license elsewhere. It was a
          confusing mess. I would easily forget which services I had even
          subscribed to until I saw an unexpected charge from one of my youtube
          memberships on my bank statement.
        </p>

          The greatest difficulty was forgetting reminders. Without a single
          location to view future payments, I was constantly caught off guard,
          and it became tough to budget. I realized I needed an easy,
          centralized solution to view everything at once and receive timely
          reminders before a bill is due. That personal pain was the direct
          inspiration for creating SubSphere: an easy, clean way to regain
          control over repeating bills.
